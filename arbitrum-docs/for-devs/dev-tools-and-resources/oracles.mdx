The following [oracles](../../for-devs/concepts/oracles.mdx) will help you integrate off-chain data into your decentralized apps (dApps):

## Chainlink

[Chainlink](https://chain.link/) is a widely-recognized Web3 services platform that specializes in decentralized oracle networks. It lets you build Ethereum and Arbitrum dApps that connect to a variety of off-chain data feeds and APIs, including those that provide asset prices, weather data, random number generation, and more.

You can find an example on how to use Chainlink in your project in [this page](../../devs-how-tos/how-to-use-oracles.mdx).

## API3

[API3](https://api3.org/) is a collaborative project to deliver traditional API services to smart contract platforms in a decentralized and trust-minimized way. API3 provides the technology for Airnodes to push off-chain data to on-chain contracts. This data can then be queried directly through the Airnode (initiating a “pull-type” request) or through dAPIs (data feeds of up-to-date off-chain data).

You can find an example on how to use API3 in your project in [this page](../../devs-how-tos/how-to-use-oracles.mdx).

## Tellor

[Tellor](https://tellor.io/) is a decentralized oracle network that incentivizes an open, permissionless network of data reporting and validation, ensuring that any verifiable data can be brought on-chain. It supports basic spot prices, sophisticated pricing specs (TWAP/VWAP), Snapshot Vote Results, and custom data needs.

You can find an example on how to use Tellor in your project in [this page](../../devs-how-tos/how-to-use-oracles.mdx).

## Supra

[Supra](https://supraoracles.com/) is a novel, high-throughput Oracle & IntraLayer: A vertically integrated toolkit of cross-chain solutions (data oracles, asset bridges, automation network, and more) that interlink all blockchains, public (L1s and L2s) or private (enterprises).

## RedStone Oracles

[RedStone](https://redstone.finance/) RedStone delivers frequently updated, reliable, and diverse data feeds for your dApp on Arbitrum. RedStone is unique in many aspects, three notable ones are:
- The most gas-optimized oracle (make your dApp scalable)
- Unique price feeds (including LSTs, LRTs, RWAs and Arbitrum-native assets)
- Modular Oracle Design allows for flexibility towards user needs

RedStone operates in two models Core (Pull) and Classic (Push) both available on Arbitrum.

How to integrate [RedStone Core] (https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/smart-contract-devs/get-started/redstone-core)?
Check out RedStone [Showroom] (https://showroom.redstone.finance/) to see how data delivery with transactions and fetching data from the Demo contract works on Arbitrum. The RedStone Core model allows your dApp to utilize data feeds delivered “on-demand”, only when the data is needed. Thanks to the implementation of the EVM-connector library and extending your Ethers.js, your dApp will be able to attach signed data packages with timestamps to call data of your users’ transactions.

In order to implement the Core model you will need to do two things:
1. Adjust the Javascript code of your dApp to inject the additional payload with signed data feeds to call data of your users’ transactions (otherwise you will get smart contract errors).
2. Adjust your smart contracts to include the libraries responsible for data extraction from call data and signature verification.

Please see the specific steps and ready code samples [in the Docs] (https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/smart-contract-devs/get-started/redstone-core).
If you need help with integration [join RedStone Discord] (https://discord.com/invite/PVxBZKFr46) and ask their team for help.

How to integrate [RedStone Classic] (https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/smart-contract-devs/get-started/redstone-classic)?
The RedStone Classic model ensures that data is pushed into on-chain storage via a relayer. Dedicated to protocols designed for the traditional Push Oracles model, that want to have full control of the data source and update conditions (heartbeat and deviation threshold).

The on-chain contracts in Classic enable storing prices and getting them through a familiar interface (e.g. [the Chainlink Aggregator] (https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.7/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol)).
